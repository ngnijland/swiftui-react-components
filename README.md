# SwiftUI React Components

I really like the structure and workings of the default component set that Apple supplies while developing in SwiftUI. I decided to play around a bit to see if the same structure would work on web.

I started adding all components that are used in this tutorial: https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/creating-and-combining-views

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
